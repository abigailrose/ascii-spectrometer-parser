## ASCII File Parser for Ocean Optics

### How to use:
1. Click the download button on the repository page (where you see the file parse.py)
2. Move the file parse.py into the directory where you keep your ASCII files (you will need to have these downloaded onto your computer to use this tool.
3. Open up a Terminal (OSX/Linux) or PowerShell (Windows) window
4. Navigate to the folder where your ASCII files are (if you don't know how to do this, I recommend putting the folder on your Desktop and looking up command line basics for Windows/Mac. It's super easy I promise.)
5. Type `which python3` on Mac, "where.exe python3" for Windows
6. If it says you don't have python3, install python3 here (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
7. For Mac, type "chmod +x parse.py" to make it executable (if you have Windows you can try skipping this step, and if it doesn't let you run it, try looking up "make permissions executable windows"
8. To run: type python3 parse.py
9. When it requests a filename, give it the full name of your .txt file including the extension
10. A csv file will be generated! You can now open this in Excel and easily plot it!
